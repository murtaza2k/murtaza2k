## 🏥 Senior Integration Architect | Healthcare IT | HL7 & API Specialist

I am a **Senior Integration Architect** with **15+ years of experience** in the healthcare industry, specializing in **HL7-based integrations**, **API-driven architectures**, and **enterprise healthcare interoperability**.

I currently work at **Mediclinic Middle East**, where I design, build, and operate **large-scale, mission-critical integration platforms** that reliably exchange data between:

- Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems  
- HL7-enabled clinical applications  
- Bedside medical devices (BMDI)  
- National health information exchanges  
- Insurance, regulatory, and external partner systems  
- Modern REST & FHIR APIs  

My primary focus is ensuring **data accuracy, system reliability, performance, and clinical safety** in complex healthcare ecosystems.
